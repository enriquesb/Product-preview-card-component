## My process

First I built the structure of the site with a main div that contained a div for the images an a div for the text. I styled all the elements an text with CSS and then I used flexbox to give form to the site. I tweaked margin values of several elements to try to make my site look as close to the design as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

With this challenge I am solidifying my knowledge of Flexbox to arrange the elements of a website.


### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Very helpful guide to learn how to use Flexbox.
